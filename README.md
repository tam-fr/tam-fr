# Hi there, I'm Tam ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developer by day and a SQL detective by night. While most people enjoy solving puzzles on paper, I dive into databases hunting down rogue queries and optimizing joins like a pro. When Iâ€™m not crafting sleek user interfaces, youâ€™ll find me writing complex SQL scripts that make data dance and sing.

I believe every table has a story and every query is a mystery waiting to be solved. With a coffee in one hand and my keyboard in the other, I turn tangled data into neat, actionable insights â€” one SELECT at a time.
